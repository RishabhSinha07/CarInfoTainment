# CarInfoTainment

### Why:
* While charging the EEV, people get bored. We want to provide them with a solution to use that time for something productive or entertaining.
* Currently there are no such tools that support screeen sharing or mirroning on a separate device for all the applications such as Netflix, Youtube, Gaming, Video call, etc.
* Companies like TATA are aiming to put a lot of EEV in the market in the near furute, therefore this will be required.
